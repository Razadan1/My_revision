# BETTY
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!!!. Let's discuss **betty**

## What is Betty?ðŸ¤”
Betty is a code checker. It checks if our codes are intact.
Betty also refers to **betty-style**, it is a tool that helps programmers adhere to coding rules and styles and it is a set of guidelines and conventions used in writing codes. It is also related to the **Linux Kernel Coding Style**, it is designed to ensure consistent and readable code.
Betty is a script that runs against source code files to automatically check for violations of the coding rules and styles.
Betty checks our code and raises a red flag if spaces and likely characters are misused.
The guidelines betty covers are:
- Tabs or Indentation
- Spaces
- Naming conventions
- comments and more

#### Using tools like betty helps programmers to easily collaborate on the same codebase. It improves code readability and maintainability

## Installing betty
Installing betty is very simple and doesn't take time.
### Steps to installing betty
- Step 1: Have a betty repo in which it is licensed and all rules are intact. If you don't have any, you click on [betty](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty)
- Step 2: Go to the betty repository.
- Step 3: Clone the betty repo to your local machine.
- Step 4: cd into your betty directory.
- Step 5: Install the linter with 'sudo ./install.sh' on your terminal
- step 6: Create a new file called betty and copy the script below copy from ''' - ''' on the script

'''
#!/bin/bash

\# Simply a wrapper script to keep you from having to use betty-style

\# and betty-doc separately on every item.

\# Originally by Tim Britton (@wintermanc3r), multiargument added by

\# Larry Madeo (@hillmonkey)


BIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin"

BETTY_STYLE="betty-style"

BETTY_DOC="betty-doc"


if [ "$#" = "0" ]; then

    echo "No arguments passed."
    
    exit 1


fi


for argument in "$@" ; do

    echo -e "\n========== $argument =========="
    
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_STYLE} "$argument"
    
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_DOC} "$argument"

done
'''
- Step 7: Once saved, exit the file and change permission to apply to all users with 'chmod a+x betty'
- Step 8: Move the betty file into /bin/ or somewhere else in your $PATH with 'sudo mv betty /bin/'
Step 9: You can now type betty file_name to run the betty linter

Then your codes will be checked and if any violation occurs it is flagged by betty.
